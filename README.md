This is a OpenGL template using C/C++ with no dependencies.  
It features window creation, OpenGL function pointers, wrappers to the pointers, and much more!  
I made this for my new demotool.  
It's setup to be optimized for democoding, that's why you will find "minicrt.lib" in the build.cmd. If you don't want to optimize the C runtime library remove that "dependency".  
The filesize is around 7kb (using minicrt and a fragment shader predefined).
